Third and I hope the last one version of gallery for my parents-in-low

I've started to learn code making a web for my parents-in-law - github.com/Vanilna/Vytiahlovski_Gallery , 
but as I was only learning it got confusing and as I also had a better concept for its design, I've decided to make it from scratch.

It is an art gallery of two artists. It should contain:

1) slide show as a first screen;
2) presentation of the artist's biography
3) presentation of their works
4) list of their exhibitions and achievements

The home page should be a landing page containing shortcuts of all these elements and starting with the slide show.

The biography, gallery of works and achievements should have their own pages for both artists.

I will write this web using pure js. The project of this web You can find in project.studio file in the main directory.

Wish me luck ;)
